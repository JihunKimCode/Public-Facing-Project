focus on students as target audience

Students feel tired/energy saving by using ChatGPT
-> 

how they use ChatGPT?
-> take answer/ write instruction

What student can do and should not do with ChatGPT?
-> take structure / avoid putting metaphor in every section

Still, you can use ChatGPT, but be careful with citation, wrong infos.

Prompt needs to be detail.
