                        Recently, many students have been using generative AI such as <strong>ChatGPT or Bing Chat</strong>. 
                        Some people worry about GenAI too much while some people do not care about it at all. 
                        Throughout the ENGL355 Public-Facing Project, I want to check does all worries are acceptable.

                        This website surveys students at UTK to find out their <b>perceptions of ChatGPT</b>, one of the GenAIs, 
                        by examining whether they use ChatGPT in their writing and why they do or do not use it.
                        In addition, the survey presents texts generated by ChatGPT and texts written by humans to check whether these texts can be distinguished.
                        As a stretch goal, the survey tried to figure out the differences between students who took ENGL 355/357 which are Rhetoric and Writing course taught by

All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage.

The heat is tempered by sea breezes, but in the narrow enclosed valleys it becomes very intense.

                        [4] The Civil War, spanning 1861-1865, was a defining chapter in American history. Rooted in sectional tensions over slavery and states' rights, it culminated in a devastating conflict between the Union and the Confederacy. Battles like Gettysburg and Antietam left indelible marks on the nation's psyche. President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation transformed the war's purpose, making the abolition of slavery a central goal. The war's aftermath witnessed the struggle for Reconstruction and the challenge of rebuilding a fractured nation. The Civil War's impact echoes through time, shaping the trajectory of American society and politics, and underscoring the enduring struggle for justice and unity.

                                    Using metaphor can help most readers to <b>imagine easily</b>. 
                                    Considering that a neural network is not a concept that can be easily understood by both communities of computer science majors and noncomputer science majors, 
                                    it is quite commendable that the AI-generated text was written using this metaphor.

                                    However, this essay tends to <b>overuse metaphors</b>. 
                                    Consistent metaphors can increase immersion in the text, 
                                    but trying to force metaphors related to the orchestra into every chapter somewhat weakens the text‚Äôs ability to convey information.

                        <b>Disagreement</b>: Text 4 was also created in a similar way to text 1, but due to the unnatural word selection and sentence structure, it was recognized that it was written by ChatGPT.

                        <b>Agreement</b>: The long essay written by ChatGPT-3.5 was written with many different complex prompts. It also shows that ChatGPT does not follow the prompt well (e.g. less than 1000 words).
                        <br>Additionally, ChatGPT was overly obsessed with the prompt to use metaphors and overused metaphors in all sections, degrading the quality of the writing.

                        <b>Disagreement</b>: Only 20% of respondents realized that Text 1 was written by ChatGPT even though the prompt was not complex. It means that the prompt does not need to be complex to get good writing from ChatGPT.

                        Both the survey through Google form and the analysis of essays written by ChatGPT show that GenAI can provide <b>great assistance</b> in writing, 
                        but it is difficult to show a level that can replace writers. 
                        When using GenAI such as ChatGPT, the user's capabilities greatly affect the results. 
                        <b>In other words, the more you know, the better you can use it.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, we were unable to find any significant differences in the statistical analysis results between students taking ENGL 355/357 and those who did not. The exact reason is not clear, but it seems to be because there is not much difference in the students' perspectives on writing.
                        <br><br>
                        The difference in the level of ChatGPT-generated text contributes to the difference in people's perception of ChatGPT. Some of the texts written by ChatGPT seem to leave something to be desired in ChatGPT's word choice, as people say. However, other writings, unlike what people say, show such good word choice that it makes people question whether they were written by ChatGPT. Technology develops rapidly, but people's perceptions cannot keep up with the pace. Therefore, <b>it was difficult to conclude that certain perceptions from different people were right or wrong</b>.
